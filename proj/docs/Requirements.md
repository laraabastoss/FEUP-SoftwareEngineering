## Requirements


### User Stories

<li> As a student I want to be able to search for places and filter my search by factors such as location, categories, popularity etc., so that I can figure out where to study.

<li> As a student I intend to learn more information about the places (eg. schedule, rating, categories, more affluent hours, Wi-Fi availability) so that I can make wiser choices about where to study.

<li> As a student I wish to sign up in the app so that I can comment, rate and suggest new places.

<li> As a student I want to be able to send a predefined message to a group or a person in another app so that I can invite my friend to study where I am.

<li> As a student I want to be able to edit my profile (email, password, name) so that my information is up to date.

<li> As an administrator I plan to be able to accept or decline users' suggestions, so that I can assure all the information is reliable.


### Domain Model
  
Each local represents a study spot, that is associated with a specific locatio. Each spot also has multiples categories, that help describing it. Users can either be students or administrators and can evaluate each spot with a rating and a comment.
