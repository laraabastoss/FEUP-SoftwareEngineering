### Retrospective
Overall, the team felt that the iteration went well 
and we were able to accomplish what was expected of us.
We were able to work on the user stories and create the necessary features, 
such as the sign up and login pages, backend, logo, and database. 
We also addressed the issues identified during the previous iteration 
and were able to complete them."
